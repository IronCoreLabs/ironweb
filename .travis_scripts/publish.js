/*
 * IronWeb SDK Publish File
 * ========================
 *
 * This script is meant to publicly publish our ironweb shim to NPM for customer consumption. It takes the version to publish as an argument and then moves the code from our
 * internal shim NPM package to the external one. It performs the following operations:
 *
 *  + Verify the associated frame version is in production. If the equivalent version of the frame that goes with this shim isn't yet in production, the publish will abort and
 *    fail. This allows us to verify before we make the shim public that it will work for customers against the production environment.
 *
 *  + Download the internal shim from NPM for the version to deploy. It then cleans up the package.json file for that package to remove all the NPM added cruft.
 *
 *  + Change the name of the package to our public shim NPM package.
 *
 *  + If the '--publish' option is provided, it will then perform the actual NPM publish step, otherwise we'll perform a dry run for testing purposes.
