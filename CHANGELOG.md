# IronWeb SDK Changelog

The IronWeb SDK NPM releases follow standard [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org) style versions. The versions of the SDK are in the form `major.minor.patch`.

**Note:** The patch versions of the IronWeb SDK will not be sequential and might jump by multiple numbers between sequential releases.

## v3.2.1

User Key Rotation feature. Users can now be created with a `needsRotation` flag. This flag can be used to mark that the private key for this user should be rotated when the user "takes control" of their keys. The main use case for this is a workflow that requires the users to be generated prior to them logging in for the first time. In this situation, a user's cryptographic identity can be generated by a third party, like a server process, and then the user can take control of their keys by subsequently rotating the private key after their first login. A users key can be rotated using the `sdk.user.rotateMasterKey(password)` method.

+ Added an optional options object to the `createNewUser` method. Currently takes a single optional `needsRotation` key which will mark the user as needing rotation upon creation.
+ Return structure after calling `sdk.initialize()` now includes a `needsRotation` boolean that denotes if the currently authenticated user has been flagged as needing rotation. If a user is marked as needing rotation, it should occur immediately after the `initialize()` Promise has resolved.
+ Added a new method to the User namespace, `sdk.user.rotationMasterKey(password)`. Requires the users password to unlock their current master private key. Calls to rotate the users key can be done at any time, regardless of whether the users record is curretly flagged for rotation.

### SDK

## v3.0.7

### Other Changes

- Fix bug where the `FrameUtils.documentToByteParts` would error if the `document` had a `byteOffset` which was non-zero.

## v3.0.6

### Other Changes

- Fix bug where the `DocumentSDK.getDocumentIdFromBytes` would error if the documentData had a `byteOffset` which was non-zero.

## v3.0.5

### Breaking Changes

- Removed support for browsers which don't support WebAssembly. This primarily means that support for IE has been removed. Performance in IE was always bad enough that it made the library nearly unusable. In addition, because of support for WebCrypto within IE it was less secure than other browsers.

### Other Changes

- Added a top level `createNewUser` method which can be called prior to SDK initialization. This method takes a callback to a valid JWT and the users escrow password as arguments. This method will create a new identity for the user ID specified in the JWT but it _will not_ generate a new device key for that user.

- Added a top level `createNewDeviceKeys` method which can be called prior to SDK initialization. This method takes a callback to a valid JWT and the users existing escrow password as arguments. This method will genreate a new set of device keys (encryption and signing) for the user ID specified in the JWT. The full key set will be returned once the Promise this method returns resolves.

- Added a new document namespace `sdk.document.advanced` which allows encrypting/decrypting documents while also returning the encrypted document encryption keys (EDEK) instead of having them stored within the IronCore service. Currently only supports a method for decrypting unmanaged documents.

## v2.0.1

### Breaking Changes

-   Moved all DocumentSDK operations to deal with `Uint8Array`, we no longer assume base 64 strings.
    -   `Document.encrypt` always returns data as `Uint8Array`.
    -   `Document.decrypt` always accepts data as `Uint8Array`.
    -   `Document.getDocumentIDFromBytes` expects data as `Uint8Array`.
    -   Use `IronWeb.codec` utility functions for easy interop with `base64` and `utf8` strings.

## v1.2.9

-   Fixed exported TypeScript types.
-   Upgraded version of RecryptJS (only used for non WebAssembly browsers) to consume Schnorr signing fixes.

## v1.2.7

-   WebAssembly! The IronWeb SDK will use the [Recrypt WASM module](https://github.com/IronCoreLabs/recrypt-wasm-binding) to greatly improve performance of most cryptographic operations. The WebAssembly module will automatically be used if the browser supports it (currently MSEdge, Chrome, Safari, and Firefox). No changes are required to consume this change. All these performance benefits are automatically applied in this new version.

## v1.1.4

-   Added created and updated timestamps to all document and group methods which return details about the document/group. These timestamps are strings formatted in RFC3339 format which can be passed directly into the `Date` constructor (e.g. `new Date(document.created)`).

## v1.1.2

-   Upgraded version of internal RecryptJS dependency.

## v1.1.1

-   Added new [`IronWeb.group.update()`](https://docs.ironcorelabs.com/ironweb-sdk/group#update-group) method to update a group. Currently only supports updating the name to a new value or clearing the name.
-   Added new [`IronWeb.group.delete()`](https://docs.ironcorelabs.com/ironweb-sdk/group#group-delete) method to delete a group. Group deletes are permanent and will cause all documents that are only encrypted to the group to no longer be decryptable. Use caution when calling this method.
-   Added restrictions for user, group, and document IDs. If any method is called with an ID that doesn't confirm to the ID requirements, that method will throw. IDs are now restricted to the following characters:
    -   Any number (0-9)
    -   Any uppercase or lowercase letter from a-z
    -   The following special characters `_.$#|@/:;=+'-`
    -   Be at most 100 characters long

## v1.0.12

-   Updated version byte on the front of all encrypted documents to version two. Encrypted documents now contain the ID of the document embedded as a header of the document.
-   Added a new document method [`IronWeb.document.getDocumentIDFromBytes()`](https://docs.ironcorelabs.com/ironweb-sdk/document/#get-id-from-bytes) which takes an encrypted document and attempts to parse the header to retrieve the document ID. If the document was an older, version 1 document, `null` will be returned.

## v1.0.11

-   Added version byte to the front of all encrypted documents. This byte will represent an all-encompassing flag to denote the details about how documents are symmetrically encrypted. This will allow for backward compatible future modification if changes are made to how documents are symmetrically encrypted.
-   Updated all dependencies to the latest version

## v1.0.5
